========

During this workshop you won't be allowed to commit to this repo.
Fork it, make sure your commits are clean and then send a pull request.


Rules 
=====
Only one change/feature/fix per commit. Commits touching multiple things
will be rejected (that is, if your commit message contains the word
"and").

Write proper commit messages using capitlization and proper punctuation,
or your pull request will get rejected.

Create a new branch for each fix.

Let's keep our history clean, rebase before pushing, or your pull request will get rejected.
